## Compare Deep Learning vs Traditional Supervised Learning Machine Learning approach

####  Multi-classes Classification ML models: through **scikit-learn** library and **NLP packages
####  Deep Learning: through **TensorFlow and Keras frameworks


More specifically, we're addressing the NLP problem by building the follow Text Classification models:

>### **Classic Supervised learning models( Scikit-learn)**
>> #### Model 0: Naive Bayes (baseline)
>> #### Model 1: Random Forest
>> #### Model 2: XGBoost
>> #### Model 3: Support Vector Machine 
>> #### Model 4: Logistic Regression 

>### **Deep Learning with NLP text preprocessing (TensorFlow/Keras)**
>>#### Model 5: RNNs (LSTM)
>>#### Model 6: TensorFlow Hub Pretrained Feature Extractor (Transfer Learning use USE)
